What is happening:

1. React fetches (gets data) from url
2. React uses the fetch api to perform a POST request to the url it fetched data from (/api)
3. React sends a request containing a newUser to the server
4. Express takes the POST request at /api using app.post()
5. Express accesses the request using the req object and appends the newUser onto the existing users array

What needs to happen:

- 1. Display user names in React - fetch all docs from db, only name field projection, render ul and have each li contain user.name
- 2. Make Edit button and Delete button

3. Make edit function - When click edit button, turn li into input with the li current value. create submit button to submit edit to DB and cancel button to cancel edit.

- 4. Make Delete function - need to use a function to get doc id so it knows which one to delete
