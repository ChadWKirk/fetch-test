What is happening:

1. React fetches (gets data) from url
2. React uses the fetch api to perform a POST request to the url it fetched data from (/api)
3. React sends a request containing a newUser to the server
4. Express takes the POST request at /api using app.post()
5. Express accesses the request using the req object and appends the newUser onto the existing users array

What needs to happen:

*1. Display user names in React - fetch all docs from db, only name field projection, render ul and have each li contain user.name
2. Make Edit button and Delete button
3. Make edit function
4. Make Delete function
