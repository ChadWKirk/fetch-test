What is happening:

1. React fetches (gets data) from url
2. React uses the fetch api to perform a POST request to the url it fetched data from (/api)
3. React sends a request containing a newUser to the server
4. Express takes the POST request at /api using app.post()
5. Express accesses the request using the req object and appends the newUser onto the existing users array

What needs to happen:

1. Instead of sending a POST request containing a predefined newUser, need to update the newUser's values using an onChange function with a text input field
2. Instead of Express having the users array, need to create a DB with the users
